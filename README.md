## crt.sh Golang Client
This is a _tiny_ and useless client in golang for retrieving certificate data from the website `crt.sh`, 
which is a web interface (Run by Comodo) for the distributed database known as the `certificate transparency logs`.
Please see ['What is Certificate Transparency?'](certificate-transparency.org/what-is-ct) for more information.
